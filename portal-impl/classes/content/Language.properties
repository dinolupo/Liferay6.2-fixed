staged-portlets-alert=When a portlet is checked, its data will be copied to staging and it may not be possible to edit them directly in live. When unchecking a portlet make sure that any changes done in staging are published first, because otherwise they might be lost.
staged-portlets-help=Portlets that are checkmarked will be <em>Staged</em>. This means that their data is published automatically whenever a page containing them is published. Those portlets which are disabled and checkmarked are always automatically exported even if they are not on the page. Those which are disabled and not checkmarked are never automatically published. <em>Collaboration</em> portlets, such as <em>Blogs</em>, <em>Message Boards</em> and <em>Wiki</em> are excluded from being <em>Staged</em> by default as their data typically originates in Live. Effectively, when a portlet is <em>NOT Staged</em> the <em>Live</em> environment contains the only important data. When <em>Local Live</em> staging is used, the same data will be displayed whether viewing the portlet from either environment.
